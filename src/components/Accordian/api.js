    que:'1. What are the limitations of React?',
    Ans:'React is not a full-blown framework as it is only a library.The components of React are numerous and will take time to fully grasp the benefits of all.It might be difficult for beginner programmers to understand React.Coding might become complex as it will make use of inline templating and JSX.'},
    {id:2,
    que:'2. What is React?',
    Ans:'React is a front-end and open-source JavaScript library which is useful in developing user interfaces specifically for applications with a single page. It is helpful in building complex and reusable user interface(UI) components of mobile and web applications as it follows the component-based approach.'},
    {id:3,
    que:'3. What is JSX?',
    Ans:`JSX stands for JavaScript XML. It allows us to write HTML inside JavaScript and place them in the DOM without using functions like appendChild or createElement.As stated in the official docs of React, JSX provides syntactic sugar for React.createElement function.${<br/>}Note- We can create react applications without using JSX as well.`},
    {id:4,
    que:'4. What are the differences between functional and class components?',
    Ans:`Before the introduction of Hooks in React, functional components were called stateless components and were behind class components on a feature basis. After the introduction of Hooks, functional components are equivalent to class components.${<br/>}Although functional components are the new trend, the react team insists on keeping class components in React. Therefore, it is important to know how these components differ.

    que:'5. Why was virtual DOM introduced? ',
    Ans:'DOM manipulation is an integral part of any web application, but DOM manipulation is quite slow when compared to other operations in JavaScript. The efficiency of the application gets affected when several DOM manipulations are being done. Most JavaScript frameworks update the entire DOM even when a small part of the DOM changes.'},
